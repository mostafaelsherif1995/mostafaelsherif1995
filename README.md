Hello there,
Welcome to my GitHub profile!
This is a brief introduction about myself:

I am an embedded systems lover, knowledge seeker, and curious learner.

In addition, I am an ambitious Embedded Software Engineer with +1 years of practical experience engineering and developing Embedded Software for different projects, including but not limited to ADAS projects. I also have experience in different parts of the AUTOSAR architecture, configuring BSW Modules, and implementing software application.

And besides my full time job as a software engineer, I am also passionate about taking my part in spreading free high quality knowledge on the form of articles, posts, and videos. I created this GitHub account for this purpose, so I could share with you high quality industry-grade code.

My greatest technical interest is 'Code Quality'.
